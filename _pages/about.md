Welcome to my page! I'm Christopher Lee, a class of 2024 student at Columbia University majoring in Computer Science. I am currently a TIP SWE intern at [Capital One](https://www.capitalone.com/) working as an applied researcher. I am also an undergraduate researcher at Columbia's [Creative Machines Lab](https://www.creativemachineslab.com/) led by [Professor Lipson](https://www.hodlipson.com/).

My research interests include all things ML-related. Recently, I've been taking a deeper dive into deep learning theory; I am also keenly interested in generative computer vision, unsupervised learning, and the broader umbrella of theoretical machine learning.
